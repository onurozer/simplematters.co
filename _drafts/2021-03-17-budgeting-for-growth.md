Figuring out how much to spend on marketing is challenging.

On one hand, bootstrapped founders sometimes pride themselves on not spending any money on marketing â€“ an approach that is more ideological than practical. While it is worthwhile to aspire for pure organic growth, dogmatic opposition to paid marketing can be detrimental as markets mature and competition increases.

On the other hand, there are the VC funded unicorns who throw cheap capital at the problem, sacrificing profitability for market share. This approach is a gamble and it is not sustainable.

In the middle, there is everyone else. Allocating an arbitrary 4-12%, usually spread across tactical test & learn experiment,s in search of the **one true acquisition channel**. The simplicity of this approach is alluring, but advertising usually requires a minimum investment to be effective. Experiments without a strategic foundation and sufficient budgets end up producing misleading results or no results at all.

## Budgeting questions to ask

A realistic marketing budget should be based on [realistic marketing goals]({% link _posts/2021-03-04-setting-realistic-goals.md %}) instead. Without the help of the purchase funnel, budgets are destined to be arbitrary. Here are a few questions to help you set a realistic budget:

### Do you really need a budget?

Paid advertising is one of the many tactical options for achieveing your goals. What are the others? Can you come up with creative solutions that don't require big budgets to execute? For a small business, advertising should serve to amplify organic growth, not substitute for it.

### What's the impact of achieving your goals?

Let's say you managed to increased awareness from 12% to 15%. How many additional purchases would that result in? What is the lifetime value of the new customers you would acquire? Setting a benchmark for success will help you understand how much value you create as a result of marketing.

### What's the minimum required budget to achieve your goals?

Given your goals, what is the minimum realistic budget that you need? Look at industry benchmarks and talk to other startups and agencies who are good at buying media, and you will start to get a sense for the investment needed to move the needle.

### What's your time horizon?

The higher up the funnel you go, the bigger the impact but the longer it will take to see any results. For example, increasing brand awareness will be effective but slow and expensive. Inversely, improving sales conversion will be quicker and cheaper but will have much smaller impact. Expecting short term results from long term investments often results in frustration. Make sure you set the right time horizon.

## A better way to set marketing budgets

By starting from zero, combining creative thinking, incremental revenue and realistic a time horizon, you can start evaluating potential marketing activities as investments. This approach takes the guesswork out of budgeting, and protects you from the extremes.

Jeff Bezos was famously quoted for having said: "_Advertising is the price you pay for having an unremarkable product_".
