Hi, I'm Onur, the marketer behind Simple Matters.

For the past two decades, I've led digital marketing for Asia at [American Express](https://www.americanexpress.com/) and [Mastercard](https://www.mastercard.com), produced digital work for global brands at [R/GA](https://www.rga.com), build and grew an e-commerce startup in Singapore and founded a digital agency in Istanbul, Turkey.

Now with Simple Matters, I share the lessons I learned on how to build great brands and grow sustainably. Connect with me on [Twitter]({{ site.data.socials[0].href }}) or [LinkedIn]({{ site.data.socials[1].href }}).
