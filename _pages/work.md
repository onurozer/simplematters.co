title: Strategy, not Spaghetti
---

I work directly with founders and marketers to help them grow their business:

- **You have an existing product**. Customers already pay to you use your products or services.
- **You're ready to scale**. You want to take your business to the next stage but not sure how.
- **You're not looking for a silver bullet**. You prioritize profitable, sustainable growth over quick hacks.

A typical engagement takes a few weeks and includes research, targeting, positioning and strategy development. 

After working together, you will gain clarity on how to grow your business, backed by decades of marketing research and real-world experience. No fluff, just solid insights and actionable next steps.
