Hi, I'm Onur, the marketer behind Simple Matters.

For the past two decades, I've led digital marketing for Asia at [American Express](https://www.americanexpress.com/) and [Mastercard](https://www.mastercard.com), produced digital work for global brands at [R/GA](https://www.rga.com), build and grew an e-commerce startup in Singapore and founded a digital agency in Istanbul, Turkey.

Now with Simple Matters, I share the lessons I learned on how to build great brands and grow sustainably. Connect with me on [Twitter](<%= site.metadata.social.twitter %>) or [LinkedIn](<%= site.metadata.social.linkedin %>).

## Writing

## Podcast

During the pandemic, I co-hosted the startup growth podcast <%= link_to "Strategy & Sourdough.", "https://www.strategyandsourdough.com" %>. Each episode explores how startups can achieve profitable growth and build lasting brands.

## Consulting

I work with founders and marketers to help them grow their business. <%= link_to "Learn more.", "consulting.md" %>
