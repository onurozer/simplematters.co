title: Strategy, not Spaghetti
---

I work directly with founders and marketers to help them grow their business:

- **You have a great product**. Customers are happy to use and pay for your products or services.
- **You're ready to scale**. You want to have a solid growth strategy in place to take your business to the next stage.
- **You're not looking for a silver bullet**. You're ready to to put in the hard work and commit instead of throwing ideas at a wall to see what sticks.

A typical engagement takes about 4 weeks, about 6 hours per week. After working together, you will gain clarity on how to grow your business, and walk away with a strategy backed by decades of marketing research and real-world experience. No glossy decks and fluff, just solid insights and actionable next steps.
